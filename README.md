# ALLOCINOCHE
  Website that reference movies/series and show :
   - Title
   - Poster
   - Plot
   - Release date
   - Director
   - Writer
   - Actors
   - Charts rating
    
 Users can add movies/series to the website via + button.
 It use [movie-database-alternative](https://rapidapi.com/rapidapi/api/movie-database-alternative/) to add new content on the website
 
 This was a school project, the rule was to display movies (title, actors and rating only)from our PostgresSQL database but... I went like this :)
 In the future, I will refactor this in Vuejs or React, adding user profile and watched movie list with personal rating and also being able to share a user's profile. 
# Disclaimer
